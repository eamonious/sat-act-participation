## Trends in SAT and ACT Participation, 2017-18

The ACT has been outpacing the SAT for participation rates in recent years, steadily gaining ground.  The College Board implemented some major design changes in 2016 and has asked us to look at recent SAT and ACT participating and scoring data by state in 2017 and 2018 to see if we can glean any recommendations from this data for how the SAT might be able to increase SAT participation moving forward.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

The ACT and SAT participation distributions roughly mirror each other, with states tending to prefer one test or the other. ACT shows a large group of highly committed states, and a higher baseline participation nationwide.  SAT shows a larger group of states with 50-80% particpation, as well as a smaller set of highly committed states.

ACT and SAT scores are inversely correlated with their respective participation rates.  This is likely due to selection bias, as low participation means those who are participating tend to be higher achieving, and high participation means diluted quality of performance.

There are strong regional (and possibly political) affiliations associated with ACT versus SAT preference.  Coastal progressive states tend to favor the SAT, while Midwestern and Mountain conservative states tend to favor the ACT.

The SAT made clear gains in 2018 relative to the ACT.  The states making these gains tended to be states in the 10-15% participation range, at the upper edge of the lower bloc, or in the 70% range, at the upper edge of the middle bloc, in the distribution of SAT participation by state.  Targeting states in similar positions in the 2018 distribution should be promising  for the College Board moving forward.
